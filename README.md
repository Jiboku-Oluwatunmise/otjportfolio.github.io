## Technical Projects 

### Project 1
! [Power BI - Adventure Works' Retail Sales Person Dashboard](https://github.com/Jiboku-Oluwatunmise/Hankali-Data-Senior-Power-Bi-)

In this project, I analysed the Adventure Work sales dataset. My findings were: 


a) The compounded YoY targets given to the sales professionals were never achieved. This means the targets were overzealous for the sales professional. Especially since they only attained sales worth $77.6M out of $676.21M. 

b) Q3 was the most impactful sales quarter for the company. However, their value added resellers could make sales in any quater. Similarly, the period of sales differ by salesperson. However, generally speaking, Q3 was the most impactful quarter, particularly in July.

c) Out of the four major components sold by Adventure Works, Bikes were the product with the most sales. Therefore, Adventure works should focus more on Bike sales than other sales. 


### Project 2

! [SQL Query - of Adventure Works](https://github.com/Jiboku-Oluwatunmise/Hankali-Data-Senior-SQL)

Using the same Adventure Works dataset as above, I used SQL to write a query which allowed me to have the following findings: 


a) Out of the four major components sold by Adventure Works, components was the product with a variety of colours followed by Bike. While the Power BI analysis revealed Bike were the most sold product, components were the second most sold. 

b) There were profits and losses among the sales professionals. Jae Park made the most profit, $264,949.12, while Shu Ito made the most loss, $-87,731.74. 

c) The United States made the most profit for Adventure Work through its four major parts: Northwest, Southeast, Central Southwest, and Northeast. Particularly, the Northwest in the United States had the most profit, while the Southwest made the most sales. However, the Southwest had the most cost. 

### Project 3

! [Python Script for Training Entry Level Data Analysts](https://github.com/Jiboku-Oluwatunmise/Hankali-Data-Senior-Python-Script) 

I used this script to train entry-level Data Analysts. The script covers the essential basis of leveraging Python for data science. The items covered in the script are: 

a) Types in Python

b) Operators in Python

c) Interactive Scripting

d) Looping

e) CRUD in Numpy

f) CRUD in Pandas

### Project 4

! [Market Prediction Product](https://github.com/Jiboku-Oluwatunmise/marketing-prediction-product) 

In this project, I used two sets of marketing data (testing and training) to predict which customers are most likely to purchase a particular product in a bank. The goal  is to curate a mini-application to track customers in a bank willing to buy the 'bank term deposit' product and automatically remind the CRMs to call these individuals. The project shows the development of the product through the data science process from data pre-processing to cleaning, EDA, modelling, testing-training, algorithm development, and evaluation. While the results revealed that more data is required for testing and training, the model attained a 91% accuracy score through the RandomForest Classifier. Specifically, the model can predict which customers who will not take the product and use that as a means to segment the customers who will take up the product.
