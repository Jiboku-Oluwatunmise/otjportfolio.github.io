## Technical Projects 

! [Power BI - Adventure Works' Retail Sales Person Dashboard](https://github.com/Jiboku-Oluwatunmise/Hankali-Data-Senior-Power-Bi-)

In this project, I analysed the Adventure work sales dataset. My findings were: 

a) The compounded YoY targets given to the sales professionals was never achieved. This means the targets were over-zealous for the sales professional. Especially since they only attained a sales worth $77.6M out of $676.21M. 

b) Q3 was the most impactful sales quarter for the company. However, their value added resellers could make sales in any quater. Similarly, the period of sales differ by salesperson. However, generally speaking, Q3 was the most impactful quarter, particularly during July.

c) Out of the four major components sold by Adventure Works, Bikes were the product with the most sales. Therefore, Adventure works should focus more on Bike sales than other sales. 

! [SQL Query - of Adventure Works](https://github.com/Jiboku-Oluwatunmise/Hankali-Data-Senior-SQL)

Using the same Adventure Works dataset as above, I used SQL to write a query which allowed me to have the following findings: 

a) Out of the four major components sold by Adventure works, components was the product with a variety of colours followed by Bike. While the Power BI analysis revealed Bike was the most sold product, components were the second most sold products. 

b) Within the sales professionals there were profits and losses. Jae Park made the most profit with $264,949.12 while Shu Ito made the most loss with $-87,731.74. 

c) The United States made the most profit for Adventure Work through its four major parts being Northwest, Southeast, Central Southwest, and Northeast respectively. Particularly, the Northwest in United States had the most profit while the Southwest made the most sales. However, the Southwest had the most cost.
